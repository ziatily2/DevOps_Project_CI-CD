# 🏅 Azure Olympics Data Engineering Pipeline

**End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Pipeline for Olympics Analytics!** 🚀

I've built a comprehensive data engineering solution that transforms raw Olympics data into actionable insights using cutting-edge Azure technologies.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
• Azure Data Factory for orchestration  
• Databricks & PySpark for large-scale processing  
• Azure Data Lake Gen2 for storage  
• Delta Lake for ACID transactions  
• Azure DevOps for CI/CD  

## 📊 Key Achievements
✅ Implemented medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold layers)  
✅ Processed 5 different data sources (athletes, coaches, events, NOCs)  
✅ Built dynamic, parameterized pipelines for scalability  
✅ Automated deployment with ARM templates  
✅ Created reusable Databricks notebooks for ETL processes  

## 💡 Interesting Insights Uncovered
• Gender distribution analysis across Olympic events  
• Country-wise performance metrics  
• Coach-to-athlete ratio patterns  
• Historical participation trends  

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
• Cloud Architecture Design  
• Big Data Processing  
• ETL/ELT Pipeline Development  
• Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
• Data Lake Implementation  
• CI/CD Best Practices  

This project showcases how modern data engineering can turn raw data into valuable insights at scale. The entire pipeline is automated, monitored, and follows industry best practices for security and performance.
